# SudokuSolver

This sudoku solver is going to use the backtracking algorithm to solve sudoku puzzles. Also learned how to use pygame in order to build a simple GUI for the sudoku game. I have plans to learn how to randomize valid sudoku boards so that there is not only a static board that can be playeed on. I also want to make a main menu page as wel as a game over and you win screen in pygame. Currently getting your third strike just closes the application window and displays "you lose" in the terrminal but I would like to make a smoother experience than this.
